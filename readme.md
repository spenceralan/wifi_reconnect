# Wifi Reconnect

This program was written to save the world!

Just kidding! It was written because I use an old MacBook as a headless server and it kept disconnecting from the internet! 

### Prerequisites

MacOS (It should work just fine with the preinstalled Ruby)

### Installing

This will only work with MacOS so if you hail from other lands the code may be foreign to your machine.

In your terminal:
* Clone this repo
* Navigate to the directory
* Run `ruby wifi_reconnect.rb`
* Answer a few questions
* Leave the terminal window open and the program running forever
* All your problems will be solved
* If you decide it didn't solve all your problems, CTR C will kill the program

## Built With
